## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.
## A pair of functions below allows to cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse matrix
## makeCacheMatrix works only with square invertible matrices

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
}
